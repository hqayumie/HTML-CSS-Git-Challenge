# Code Refactor Starter Code
I viewed the started code that was provided and added semantic HTML elements that followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I started by identifying the div tags in the html code that needed to be replaced by the HTML semantic tags. The first div tag I replaced was for the header with a section tag. I then proceeded to change the div tag at the bottom of the code for the footer with a footer tag. I then found the code for the navigation bar and placed a navigation tag there instead of the div tag. I placed section tags next to the class=hero to replace the div tags that were there before. I replaced the div tag next to the class=content with a section tag and proceeded to replace the div tags below that code with article tags for the classes "search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing."I placed an aside tag next to the class=benefits for the information that is displayed vertically on the right hand side of the webpage. Below that I placed article tags next to the classes "benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost."
